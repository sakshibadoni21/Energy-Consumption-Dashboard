# Energy Consumption Dashboard
## Problem Statement
 The dashboard is likely used by energy managers or financial analysts to monitor and analyze energy costs and consumption across various dimension(geographical, temporal, by type, and by building) to identify areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvements. The Energy Consumption Dashboard aims to provide comprehensive real-time monitoring and analysis of energy usage and costs across multiple locations and types. Issues to address include ensuring the accuracy and integrity of data from diverse sources, optimizing the dashboard for high performance with expanding datasets, enhancing user interaction for a more intuitive experience, and developing new features to deepen analytical capabilities.

## Key Insights
## 1.	Total Cost and Consumption Tracking: 
The dashboard provides a high-level view of energy consumption costs and units consumed over time, with a total cost of 15.84M and 210M units consumed. This can indicate the dashboard's ability to track and aggregate financial and quantitative energy usage data effectively.

## 2.Geographical Cost Analysis:
A map visualization titled "Total Cost by City" indicates the ability to break down energy costs geographically, allowing for region-specific analysis.

## 3. Detailed Summary Insights: 
The summary section states that New York had the highest total cost which was 20.85% higher than Houston, with the lowest total cost. This showcases the dashboard's functionality to compare and analyze data points for quick insights.

## 4. Consumption Type Breakdown:
The pie chart and stacked bar chart illustrate the breakdown of energy consumption by type (Water, Electricity, Gas) and changes in consumption patterns over time.

## 5.Building-Specific Data:
The "Unit Consumed by Building" section shows a bar chart with data on how much energy is consumed by different buildings, indicating the dashboard's ability to drill down into finer details.

## key Insights

## 1.Total Water Consumption Costs and Usage: 
The dashboard indicates a total water consumption cost of 10.81M and 186M units consumed, illustrating its capability to track water-related energy expenditure and usage volumes.

## 2.Trend Analysis Over Time:
A line graph titled "Total Cost by Date and Consumption Type" displays the fluctuation of water costs over time, which can help in identifying trends, seasonal patterns, or anomalies in water consumption costs.

## 3.City-Specific Cost Distribution: 
The doughnut chart provides a visual breakdown of total costs by city, with the ability

## key Insights

## 1.Interactivity and Filtering: 
The dashboard includes dropdown menus for filtering by building, city, and date, which suggests that it is interactive and allows users to focus on specific data sets.

## 2. Summary Metrics: 
At the top, there are large summary metrics indicating the total cost ($2.03M) and total units consumed (22M), providing a quick overview of the electricity consumption and expenditure.

## 3. Time Series Analysis: 
There's a line chart labeled "Total Cost by Date and Consumption Type" showing the cost trend over time, which can be valuable for identifying patterns or anomalies in energy consumption costs.

## 4.Geographical Cost Distribution:
A horizontal bar chart titled "Total Cost by City" compares the cost across different cities, which could be useful for regional analysis and cost management.

## 5. Detailed Data Table:
There is a data table showing a breakdown by year, quarter, month, unit consumed, and total cost, providing detailed insights into consumption and cost over time.

## 6. Consumption by Building: 
At the bottom, there is a bar chart named "Unit Consumed by Building", showing the distribution of energy consumption across different buildings, which is useful for identifying which buildings are the highest consumers of electricity.
