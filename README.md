# Energy Consumption Dashboard
## Problem Statement
 The dashboard is likely used by energy managers or financial analysts to monitor and analyze energy costs and consumption across various dimension(geographical, temporal, by type, and by building) to identify areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvements. The Energy Consumption Dashboard aims to provide comprehensive real-time monitoring and analysis of energy usage and costs across multiple locations and types. Issues to address include ensuring the accuracy and integrity of data from diverse sources, optimizing the dashboard for high performance with expanding datasets, enhancing user interaction for a more intuitive experience, and developing new features to deepen analytical capabilities.

## Key Insights
## 1.	Total Cost and Consumption Tracking: 
The dashboard provides a high-level view of energy consumption costs and units consumed over time, with a total cost of 15.84M and 210M units consumed. This can indicate the dashboard's ability to track and aggregate financial and quantitative energy usage data effectively.

## Geographical Cost Analysis:
A map visualization titled "Total Cost by City" indicates the ability to break down energy costs geographically, allowing for region-specific analysis.

## Detailed Summary Insights: 
The summary section states that New York had the highest total cost which was 20.85% higher than Houston, with the lowest total cost. This showcases the dashboard's functionality to compare and analyze data points for quick insights.

## Consumption Type Breakdown:
The pie chart and stacked bar chart illustrate the breakdown of energy consumption by type (Water, Electricity, Gas) and changes in consumption patterns over time.

## Building-Specific Data:
The "Unit Consumed by Building" section shows a bar chart with data on how much energy is consumed by different buildings, indicating the dashboard's ability to drill down into finer details.
